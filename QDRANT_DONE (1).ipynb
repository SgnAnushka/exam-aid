      "🧠 MEMORY USED: ['user asked about: what is aldehyde?', 'user asked about: what is water?', 'user asked about: what is ibuprofen?', 'user asked about: what is nitrogen?', 'user asked about: what is amino acids?']\n",
      "Resolved compound: None\n",
      "\n",
      "🧠 FINAL ANSWER:\n",
      " In general chemistry terms, an aldehyde is a type of organic compound that contains a functional group called a carbonyl group (-C=O) at the end of a carbon chain. The general structure of an aldehyde is R-CHO, where R is a hydrocarbon group (such as an alkyl or aryl group) and CHO is the aldehyde functional group.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key characteristics of an aldehyde are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The carbonyl group (-C=O) is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H) and a carbon atom (R).\n",
      "2. The carbonyl group is located at the end of the carbon chain, meaning that there is no other carbon atom attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n",
      "3. The aldehyde functional group is polar, meaning that it has a partial positive charge on the carbon atom and a partial negative charge on the oxygen atom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aldehydes are typically named by replacing the -ane suffix of the corresponding alkane with the suffix -al. For example, the aldehyde derived from methane (CH4) is called formaldehyde (HCHO), while the aldehyde derived from ethane (C2H6) is called acetaldehyde (CH3CHO).\n",
      "\n",
      "Aldehydes are important in organic chemistry because they can undergo a variety of reactions, such as oxidation, reduction, and addition reactions. They are also found in many natural products, such as fragrances, flavors, and pharmaceuticals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of common aldehydes include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Formaldehyde (HCHO)\n",
      "* Acetaldehyde (CH3CHO)\n",
      "* Benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO)\n",
      "* Glyceraldehyde (C3H6O3)\n",
